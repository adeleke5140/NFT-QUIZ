# NFT QUIZ GAME

My idea for this chainlink Hackathon was to create a Quiz game that rewards users with NFTS.
It'd use a myriad of technologies:
1. Polygon a side chain with cheaper fees and faster speeds
2. ThirdWeb sdk for creating the pack and NFT bundle
3. Chainlink for generating Random number since Blockchains are deterministic
4. ipfs for storing the images
5. NextJS and Typescript on the Frontend

Unfortunately, the ThirdWeb sdk was upgraded and it broke a lot of things.
I tried asking in the discord but sadly got no response.

This might not be enough to win the hackathon but I just wanted to show
my participation and the tools I implemented.

P.S: If you think you can help out with the ThirdWeb Issue, please ping me.
